<h1>Music-Generation-Using-Deep-Learning</h1>
Single instrument music generation using two models ->
<ol>
   <li> Restricted Boltzmann machine and</li>
   <li> Stacked LSTM model</li>
</ol>

The dataset used is stored in PES1201701295_data which contains a list of .mid files. You may choose any number of .mid files and place it in the required location.
To run the project with both the models-> python3 PES1201701295_source/main.py
To run required models only look into PES1201701295_source/Model_1.py and PES1201701295_source/Model_2.py
